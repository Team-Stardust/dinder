# dinder

Dinder is an app designed to pair your pallette with the perfect meal. Similar to a popular dating app, Dinder allows you to swipe left or right, based on the food item on display from a nearby restaurant.

# motivation

Our motivation behind building Dinder was to expand the places, and restaurants we frequent by expanding the list of options we may have previously overlooked or simply never considered as a viable option. As we all know, food talks in it's very own way and Dinder certainly has a LOT to say!
